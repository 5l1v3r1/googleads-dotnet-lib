7.0.0
- The library now uses System.Trace for logging. If you are not familiar with
  Trace listeners, you can read about them at
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4y5y10s7(v=vs.110).aspx.

  The following configuration keys are no longer available:
  -- LogPath
  -- LogToFile
  -- LogErrorsOnly

  Instead, the following trace sources/switches have been added:
  -- AdsClientLibs.SoapXmlLogs: Trace source / switch for logging SOAP xmls.
  -- AdsClientLibs.RequestInfoLogs: Trace source / switch for logging request
     details.

  You may add an appropriate listener type to the trace source to save the logs
  to a data store of your choice. We have added a TextWriterTraceListener
  entry in the default App.config; this listener gives you the functionality
  of the old behaviour where logs were written to a file on disk. The path of
  the log file can be configured using the initializeData setting of the
  listener, and is the equivalent of the old LogPath setting.

  To turn logging on / off and to set its level, you can use the trace
  switches. You can set the trace switches to one of the following values:
  - Off: This turns off logging, and is the equivalent of LogToFile: false
  - Info: This turns on logging, and is the equivalent of LogErrorsOnly: false.
  - Error: This turns on logging, and is the equivalent of LogErrorsOnly: true.
