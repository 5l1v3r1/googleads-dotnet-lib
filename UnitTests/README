Unit tests to use with the client library. The appropriate unit test should be
executed whenever you make changes to any of the core library's sources.

All unit tests should be executed against Sandbox environment.

You need to install NUnit framework (http://www.nunit.org/) to run these
tests. To run the tests,

- Download and install the latest version of NUnit from
  http://www.nunit.org/index.php?p=download.
- Add a reference for UnitTests project to nunit.framework.dll. If you are
  using Visual Studio, then you can find this entry in .NET tab of
  "Add Reference" dialog. If you are adding reference manually, you can find
  this DLL in NUNIT_INSTALL_FOLDER\bin\net-2.0\framework.
- Substitute the various keys in App.config.
- Compile the UnitTests project.
- Copy App.config to the same folder as UnitTests.dll, and rename it to
  UnitTests.dll.config.
- You can now run the tests as
       nunit-console.exe UnitTests.dll or
       nunit.exe UnitTests.dll
