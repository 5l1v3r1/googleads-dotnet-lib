AdWords API DotNet Client Library

Google's AdWords API service lets developers design computer programs that
interact directly with the AdWords platform. With these applications,
advertisers and third-parties can more efficiently - and creatively - manage
their large or complex AdWords accounts and campaigns.

AdWords API DotNet Client Library makes it easier to write .NET clients to
programmatically access AdWords accounts. The client library is provided as a
Visual Studio project that contains the generated stubs all in the
same namespace, com.google.api.adwords.vXX, where XX is the API version. There
is no need to worry about accessing the WSDL for the web services, this is done
through the classes in the client library. All duplicate classes generated from
WSDL have been removed. This is done automatically with wsdl.exe from
.NET SDK 2.0, but not with from .NET SDK 1.1. The client library is
compatible with .NET SDK 1.1 and above. Two useful SOAPExtension classes are
provided. The QuotaExtension takes care of quota unit accounting for all
services. The TraceExtension logs all SOAP requests and responses to log
files. The place where log files are stored can be configured in the App.config
file, using "logPath" key.

Demo programs in the src/examples directory demonstrate how to use client
library. To run an example, open the project file
google-api-adwords-dotnet.csproj in Visual Studio, build the project, and
execute it on command line at bin/Debug.
    > google-api-adwords-dotnet.exe AccountServiceDemo

In the .NET 1.1 SOAP layer primitive types do not get serialized by default.
.NET has no way of specifying null for a variable of a primitive type. If a
primitive type variable is a binding to a SOAP paramer defined in the WSDL as
nillable="true", in order for the variable to be serialized you need to set a
variable <parameterName>Specified to true in order for it to be serialized.
    newCampaign.budgetAmount = 1000000L;
    newCampaign.budgetAmountSpecified = true;
The members <parameterName>Specified are an artifact of the .NET SOAP library
and are not present in the original WSDL.

How do I start?
If you don't have one already, sign up for a Google Account at
https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount. Update App.config with
authentication credentials for your Google Account, to make requests against
sandbox or with authentication credentials for your AdWords account, to make
requests against production environment. The client library normally defaults
to a single version (i.e. v11). However, it may support more than one version
at a time. In order to use a different version of API the following updates
should be made. In src/lib/AdWordsUser.cs, update the following lines with the
desired version.
    using com.google.api.adwords.vXX;
    const String LAST_VERSION = "vXX";
    const int MAX_WEB_SERVICES = XX;
Also, in src/examples/Examples.cs, update the following line with the desired
version.
    using com.google.api.adwords.vXX;

How to make a release?
Update version and list of web services in Rakefile. Change client library
version in LIB_VERSION_PREFIX from src/lib/AdWordsUser.cs. Also, update library
import, LAST_VERSION, and MAX_WEB_SERVICES, if applicable. Add appropriate
header in src/lib/QuotaExtension.cs. Generate stubs from WSDLs by executing the
following command in the project's home directory (requires Ruby),
    > rake
If new version was added, create src/vXX directory and copy generated files
into it. Build the project and remove all duplicate classes manually, until
build is successful. Update examples to appriate API version. Create new
directory with a name awapi_dotnet_lib_v.v.v, where v.v.v is a version number
(i.e. 2.0.0), and copy new release into it. Pack new release into a tarball and
then gzip it,
    > tar -cvf awapi_dotnet_lib_v.v.v.tar awapi_dotnet_lib_v.v.v/
    > gzip awapi_dotnet_lib_v.v.v.tar
