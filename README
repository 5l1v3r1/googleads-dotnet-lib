Google's DoubleClick for Publishers API DotNet Client Library
=============================================================

Google's DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP) API service lets developers design
computer programs that interact directly with the DFP platform. With these
applications, advertisers and third parties can more efficiently -- and
creatively -- manage their large or complex DFP accounts

The DFP API DotNet Client Library makes it easier to write .NET clients to
programmatically access DFP accounts. All client library classes and
utilities are in the "Google.Api.Ads.Dfp" namespace or sub-namespaces.
The library is compatible with .NET SDK 2.0 and above. When using the library,
you needn't worry about downloading WSDLs and such, since the library contains
stub classes for all the supported services and takes care of details like SOAP
marshalling and unmarshalling, SOAP logging, etc. The complete documentation for
the DFP API is available from
https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-publishers/docs/start.

What's in the client library?
-----------------------------

The client library provides full access to all the functionality of the DFP
API web services plus more. It includes:

  - Data classes: The client library provides all the necessary data classes.
    For example, it provides the Campaign data class for encapsulating campaign
    data. These classes are generated automatically from WSDLs using wsdl.exe
    and post-processed to provide features like
    - Not having to specify xxxSpecified = true for each nullable property.
    - Being able to treat SOAP faults as DFP exceptions rather than as
      generic SoapExceptions.
    - Reusing types across multiple services.

  - DfpUser class: The DfpUser class provides methods for setting credentials
    for accessing DFP accounts as well as for creating instances of the DFP
    Service classes.

  - Helpful utilities: The utilities located under
    Google.Api.Ads.Dfp.Utils help you build statements, convert date strings
    into datetime objects, etc.

  - SOAP extensions: The client library provides you SOAP extensions that will
    log http messages, SOAP request and response xmls, etc.


How do I start?
---------------

The client library is provided as a Visual Studio project (source distribution),
a compiled .NET assembly (binary distribution) and as a nuget package
(nuget distribution). You may continue reading the the appropriate section
below, depending on the distribution you are using.

Nuget distribution
------------------

This is the recommended way to get the client library. The nuget distribution of
Google's DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP) API DotNet Client Library consists of
the following nuget packages:

- Google.Dfp: DFP API DotNet Client Library
- Google.Dfp.Examples: C# Code examples for DFP API.

To use the library, you can install the appropriate nuget packages and add
reference to your Visual Studio project. You can learn more about nuget package
manager at http://www.nuget.org


Binary distribution
-------------------

The binary distribution of DFP API DotNet client library consists of a
precompiled version of the library as a .NET assembly, code examples for using
the library, and library documentation. If you are interested in just using
the library and not in its internals, and you don't use nuget package manager
in your development environment, you should download this distribution.

The contents of this distribution are as follows:

  \
    \docs
      - Prebuilt help files for the client library in chm format.
    \lib
      - Precompiled assemblies.
    \examples
      - Client library examples.
    README
    ChangeLog
    COPYING

The examples folder contains code examples for all the major functionality
supported by the library for all the supported versions of the API. To run
the examples,

- Open Dfp.sln in Visual Studio.
- Open App.config for the examples project and follow the instructions in the
  file to enter required configuration values.
- Save and close App.config.
- Open the Properties dialog for the Dfp.Examples project (Right click
  the Dfp.Examples project in the Solution Explorer and select the
  Properties option from the context menu.).
- Navigate to the Debug Tab and enter the command line options. The command line
  options are of the form version.examplename. For instance,
  v201306.CreateCompanies is the command line option to run
  v201306\CompanyService\CreateCompanies.cs.
- Compile and run the Dfp.Examples project.

Alternatively, each code example has a main() method, so you can set the
appropriate code example as the Startup object (Select the Application tab on
the Dfp.Examples Properties dialog and pick the desired class from the
"Startup object" dropdown.).

You can use the library in a new project as follows:

- Create a new Visual Studio project of your choice (For instance, a C# Windows
  application).
- Copy Google.Dfp.dll and Google.Ads.Common.dll to your project directory.
  If you have a folder for keeping referenced libraries, then you may copy the
  assembly to this folder, otherwise it is a good practice to create one
  e.g \lib) to keep the referenced assembly.
- Add a reference to the assemblies and to System.Web.Services in your project.
- Copy examples\App.config to your project directory and add it to your project.
  Edit the required keys in App.config.
- Make a call to the library as follows:

  DfpUser user = new DfpUser();
  CompanyService service = (CompanyService) user.GetService(
      DfpService.v201306.CompanyService);
  // make more calls to service class.

All the supported services in the client library are available as
DfpService.vxxx.ServiceName, where vxxx is the API version (e.g. v201306)
and ServiceName is the name of the service you want to create.

Source distribution
-------------------

The source distribution of the Dfp API DotNet client library consists of
individual Visual Studio projects for the client library, code examples and
test cases, documentation for using the library, and support libraries and tools
for compiling and running the library. If you are interested in the library
internals you should download this distribution.

The contents of this distribution are as follows:

  /
    /docs
      - Prebuilt help files for the client library in .CHM format.
    /examples
      - Client library examples in C#.
    /lib
      - External client libraries referenced by various projects in the source
        distribution.
    /src
      - Client library source, provided as a Visual Studio project.
    /tests
      - NAnt test cases for the library, provided as a Visual Studio project
    README
    ChangeLog
    COPYING
    Dfp.sln

To compile and run the project:

- Open Dfp.sln in Visual Studio.
- Open App.config for the examples project and follow the instructions in the
  file to enter required configuration values.
- Save and close App.config.
- Open the Properties dialog for the Dfp.Examples project (Right click
  the Dfp.Examples project in the Solution Explorer and select the
  Properties option from the context menu.).
- Navigate to the Debug tab and enter the command line options. The command line
  options are of the form version.examplename. For instance,
  v201306.CreateCompanies is the command line option to run
  v201306\CompanyService\CreateCompanies.cs.
- Set the Dfp.Examples project as the Startup project.
- Compile and run the Dfp.Examples project.

Alternatively, each code example has a main() method, so you can set the
appropriate code example as the Startup object (Select the Application tab on
the Dfp.Examples Properties dialog and pick the desired class from the
"Startup object" dropdown.).

To run the test cases, you need to download and install the latest version of
NUnit from http://www.nunit.org/. Once you have installed NUnit, you can
compile and run the test cases as follows:

- Right click the Dfp.Tests project and choose References from the context
  menu.
  From the references dialog, add a reference to the nunit.framework assembly.
- Right click the Dfp.Tests project and choose Properties. Navigate to the
  Debug tab and choose "Start external program". Browse to the path for
  nunit.exe and pick it as the Startup application.
- Open App.config for the tests project and follow the instructions in the
  file to enter required configuration values.
- It is recommended that you run the test cases against a test network. See
  https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-publishers/docs/environments for
  details.
- Set Dfp.Tests project as the startup project and run the project.

If you wish to add the DFP client library as part of your workspace, then
you need to copy \src folder to your workspace folder and then add Dfp.csproj
to your .sln.


Configuring the client library
------------------------------

The client library may be configured using the settings exposed by App.config.
