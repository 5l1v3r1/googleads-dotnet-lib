The .NET client library for the AdWords API makes it easier to write 
.NET clients to programmatically access AdWords accounts. The client
library is provided as a Visual Studio project that contains the generated stubs
all in the same namespace. com.google.api.adwords.vx, where x is the version.
You don't need to worry about accessing the WSDL for the web services 
-- classes in the client library do it for you.

All duplicate classes generated from wsdl have been removed (wsdl.exe from .NET SDK 2.0 
does that for you, but not the one in .NET SDK 1.1).
It is compatible with .NET SDK 1.1 and above.

The .NET client library contain 2 useful SOAPExtension classes:
- QuotaExtension takes care of quota unit accounting for all services
- TraceExtension logs all requests and responses in log files.

These can be configured in your project by modifying the file App.config.
By default they are on.

You can use the demo programs in the $ADWORDS_ROOT/src/examples directory to get started
writing your own client.
The demo programs show how to use all the services.

They should work out of the box if you provide the right credentials in App.config.
To run a sample, build the project, then go to bin/Debug and run:
>google-api-adwords-dotnet.exe ClassNameOfTheDemo

The examples use the default constructor
    AdWordsUser me = new AdWordsUser();
which uses credentials provided in the current directory in google-api-adwords-dotnet.exe.config
Then you instantiate a service from the AdWordsUser object
			CampaignServiceService campaignService = (CampaignServiceService)user.getService("CampaignServiceService");
and call methods on it.
In the end you can ask the user how much quota units have been consumed.
			Console.WriteLine("Total Quota unit cost for this run: {0}", user.getUnits());
			
There is sample App.config file in the root of the project.
You need to customize it with your actual credentials before using the samples.
