0.6: api.sgrinberg@gmail.com
- Fixed endDate bug in example code.  new DateTime() defaults to "1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM", not today.
- Removed no longer supported v5.

0.5: api.sgrinberg@gmail.com
- Made v8 lib's default version.

0.4: api.sgrinberg@gmail.com
- Added support for v8. At present, v8 is available in sandbox only. Thus, 
v7 remains as default lib version.
- New AdService sevice was added.
- Additional sample for new AdService, v8 only. When using v8, few edits 
need to be done:
	= Change v7 to v8 in AdWordsUser.cs:20, (using com.google.api.adwords.v8;).
	= Change v7 to v8 in AdWordsUse.cs:35, (const String LAST_VERSION = "v8";).
	= Comment out "token" header in AdWordsUser:62, 
	  (//public token tokenValue;). In v8 "token" header was removed, use 
	  "developerToken" header instead.
