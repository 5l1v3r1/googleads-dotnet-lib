OAuth.Net.Combined - README
===========================

OAuth.Net.Combined is a custom-built version of OAuth.net library version
0.8.1.1, with the following minor patches:

- The whole library has been compiled into a single assembly for ease of
  distribution.
- OAuthRequestToken class has been modified to call EnumerationHelper.IsEqualTo
  instead of the extension method. This is done to make the code .NET 2.0
  compatible. See http://code.google.com/p/oauth-dot-net/source/browse/trunk/1.0a/OAuth.Net.Components/Tokens/OAuthRequestToken.cs#197
  for details.

OAuth.Net.Combined is made available under the same license as the original
OAuth.Net library. See OAuth.Net License.txt for details.
