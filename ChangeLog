  The new version also provides access to the underlying Stream, in case you need to process the
  report without downloading it first. The existing ReportUtilities class has been marked deprecated
  and moved to Google.Api.Ads.AdWords.Util.Reports.Legacy namespace. The deprecated version of
  ReportUtilities class will be removed on Feb 1, 2015.
