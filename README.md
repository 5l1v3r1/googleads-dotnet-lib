#DFP API DotNet Client Library

##Introduction
Google's DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP) API service lets developers design computer programs that interact directly with the DFP platform. With these applications, advertisers and third parties can more efficiently and creatively manage their large or complex DFP accounts.

The DFP API DotNet Client Library makes it easier to write .NET clients to programmatically access DFP accounts. All client library classes and utilities are in the `Google.Api.Ads.Dfp` namespace or sub-namespaces. The library is compatible with .NET SDK 2.0 and above. When using the library, you needn't worry about downloading WSDLs and such, since the library contains stub classes for all the supported services and takes care of details like SOAP marshalling and unmarshalling, SOAP logging, etc. The complete documentation for the DFP API is available from https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-publishers/docs/start.

##Features

- Support for .NET SDK 2.0 and above.
- Outgoing and incoming SOAP messages are monitored and logged.
- Support for API calls to test, beta or production environments.
- As opposed to autogenerated stubs from wsdl.exe, you don't have to specify `xxxSpecified = true` for each nullable property.
- Support for specific DFP exceptions instead of generic `SoapExceptions`.
