#DFA API DotNet Client Library

test

##Introduction
DoubleClick for Advertisers (DFA) API lets developers to build applications that interact directly with the DFA platform and perform a variety of trafficking and administrative tasks. It is particularly useful for automating recurring processes and for integrating DoubleClick for Advertisers with third-party systems.

The DoubleClick for Advertisers (DFA) API DotNet Client Library makes it easier to write .NET clients to programmatically access DFA accounts. All client library classes and utilities are in the `Google.Api.Ads.Dfa` namespace or sub-namespaces. The library is compatible with .NET SDK 2.0 and above. When using the library, you needn't worry about downloading WSDLs and such, since the library contains stub classes for all the supported services and takes care of details like SOAP marshalling and unmarshalling, SOAP logging, etc. The complete documentation for the DFA API is available from https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/docs/overview.

##Features

- Support for .NET SDK 2.0 and above.
- Outgoing and incoming SOAP messages are monitored and logged.
- Support for API calls to test, beta or production environments.
- As opposed to autogenerated stubs from wsdl.exe, you don't have to specify `xxxSpecified = true` for each nullable property.
- Support for specific DFA exceptions instead of generic SoapExceptions.
